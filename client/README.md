- This project entails a picture-based quiz game playable online, where the user views provided images
  and answers questions that are based around the topic of the provided pictures.
- Final version of the game is expected to have 3 different picture quiz games based on 3 different non-STEM subjects, namely art, music and english.
- This early version of the code, however, focuses on building a functional version of the art game only.
  Questions range from naming the responsible artist for painting displayed, when painting was completed, etc
- User will accumulate points for every correct answer and, after 10 rounds, will be directed to scorepage where final score will
  be displayed.
